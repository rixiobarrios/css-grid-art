# CSS Grid Art

For this exercise, you will be creating an *abstract work of art* using CSS Grid!  More specifically, you will be attempting to recreate a piece called *Composition with Red Blue and Yellow* by Piet Mondrian.  

### Steps to clone down and open
1. Open up Terminal
2. Change into your `exercises` directory
3. `git clone git@git.generalassemb.ly:dc-wdi-fundamentals/css-grid-art.git`
4. `cd css_grid_art` to change into the cloned down directory
5. `code .` to open the directory you are currently located in VS Code
6. `open index.html` to open your index file in your browser.

At first glance you should see something that kind of resembles the shape of the original painting but is a bit off.  Use the numbers to help you with the order and update your `style.css` file to resize and recolor your `div`s.  The first one has been done for you.  

**You will only need to edit `style.css`** to complete the exercise. You don't need to recreate the image exactly - there's a lot of subtlety here! (You can also get rid of the numbers in the `index.html` file if you'd like, they are there to help you)

Use the [painting](img/mondrian-composition-ii.jpg) of the image or [one possible solution](img/mondrian-css-solution.png) for guidance.  

### Bonus!

Create your own Mondrian-inspired works of art using CSS Grid from scratch!  You can create a new git branch with `git checkout -b branch-name`, delete the `div`s and styling and start from scratch!
